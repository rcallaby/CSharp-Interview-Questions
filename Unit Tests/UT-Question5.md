# Question 5 - Unit Tests

## How do you use mock objects to test code in isolation from its dependencies in C#?

In C#, you can use mock objects to test code in isolation from its dependencies by creating fake objects that simulate the behavior of real objects, without actually relying on those objects.

Here are the general steps for using mock objects to test code in isolation:

Identify the dependencies: Determine the external dependencies of the code you want to test, such as other classes, libraries, or services.

Create the mock objects: Create mock objects that mimic the behavior of the external dependencies. There are several popular mocking frameworks in C# such as Moq, Rhino Mocks, NSubstitute and more, which can help with creating mock objects.

Set up the mock objects: Use the mocking framework to set up the mock objects with the expected behavior. This could involve setting up return values, configuring expected interactions, and more.

Write the test code: Write the test code that exercises the code being tested, using the mock objects in place of the real dependencies.

Verify the results: Verify that the code being tested behaves as expected, by checking the results of the test code and verifying that the mock objects were used correctly.

Here's an example of using Moq to create a mock object in C#:

```
// Define an interface for the external dependency
public interface IExternalDependency
{
    int GetValue();
}

// Create a mock object using Moq
var mockDependency = new Mock<IExternalDependency>();

// Set up the mock object's behavior
mockDependency.Setup(x => x.GetValue()).Returns(42);

// Inject the mock object into the code being tested
var codeUnderTest = new MyCode(mockDependency.Object);

// Call the code being tested
var result = codeUnderTest.DoSomething();

// Verify that the mock object was used correctly
mockDependency.Verify(x => x.GetValue(), Times.Once());

```
In this example, we define an interface IExternalDependency for the external dependency, and use Moq to create a mock object mockDependency that implements this interface. We then set up the behavior of the mock object to return 42 when the GetValue() method is called. Finally, we inject the mock object into the code being tested (MyCode), call the code being tested (DoSomething()), and verify that the mock object was used correctly by checking that the GetValue() method was called once.
