## What is the difference between a method and a function in C#?

In C#, both methods and functions are used to group a set of instructions that perform a specific task. However, there are some key differences between methods and functions in C#.

A method in C# is a code block that contains a series of statements that perform a particular operation. Methods can be defined as part of a class and can have access to the class's data and properties. Methods can also have parameters that allow the method to receive input data and return a value as output. Methods can be invoked by calling them by name, and they can also be overloaded to accept different parameters or have different implementations.

A function in C# is a specific type of method that returns a value. In other words, a function is a method that performs a particular operation and then returns a value as a result of that operation. Functions can be defined with a return type, which specifies the type of the value that the function returns. The return value can be of any C# data type, including primitive types, custom types, and collections.

So the main difference between a method and a function in C# is that a function always returns a value, while a method may or may not return a value. Additionally, functions are a subset of methods that are designed to return a value.
