# Abstract Classes - Introduction

Abstract classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and understanding them is essential for any C# developer. An abstract class is a special type of class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a base for other classes. This article will explore what abstract classes are, how they work, and why you should know them inside and out before a technical interview.

## What is an Abstract Class in C#?

An abstract class is a class that is declared using the abstract keyword. It is a class that cannot be instantiated, which means that you cannot create an instance of it using the new keyword. Instead, abstract classes are used as a base class for other classes, and they are meant to be subclassed. An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract members.

Abstract members are members that do not have an implementation, and they must be implemented by a subclass. They are declared using the abstract keyword. Non-abstract members, on the other hand, have an implementation, and they can be inherited by a subclass without modification.

## How do Abstract Classes work in C#?

An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword. Here is an example:

```
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Draw();
}
```
In this example, we have declared an abstract class called Shape. It contains an abstract method called Draw, which does not have an implementation. This means that any subclass of Shape must provide an implementation for the Draw method. Here is an example of a subclass of Shape:

```
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

```
In this example, we have declared a subclass of Shape called Circle. It implements the Draw method, which provides an implementation for the abstract method declared in the Shape class.

## Why should you know Abstract Classes inside and out before a technical interview?

Abstract classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and they are widely used in C# development. Knowing abstract classes inside and out is essential for any C# developer because it demonstrates a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles. It also shows that you are familiar with the design patterns that use abstract classes, such as the Template Method pattern and the Factory Method pattern.

During a technical interview, you may be asked to explain abstract classes, how they work, and provide an example of their usage. You may also be asked to implement an abstract class and its subclass. Therefore, it is essential to know abstract classes thoroughly before a technical interview to demonstrate your knowledge and expertise in C# development.

Abstract classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and they are widely used in C# development. They provide a powerful mechanism for creating flexible and extensible code. Knowing abstract classes inside and out is essential for any C# developer, as it demonstrates a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to study abstract classes thoroughly before a technical interview to demonstrate your knowledge and expertise in C# development.
