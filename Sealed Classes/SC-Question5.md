# Question 5 - Sealed Classes

## What are the benefits of using a sealed class in C#?

Sealed classes in C# are classes that cannot be inherited by other classes. There are several benefits to using sealed classes in your C# code:

Security: Sealing a class prevents other developers from extending or modifying its behavior, which can be useful if the class contains sensitive data or code.

Performance: Sealing a class can improve performance because the C# compiler can optimize the code knowing that the class cannot be extended.

Maintenance: Sealing a class can make it easier to maintain because you don't have to worry about unexpected behavior from subclasses. This can reduce the amount of testing and debugging required.

Design: Sealing a class can be useful in your object-oriented design because it can signal that a class is meant to be a final implementation, and not a base class for other classes.

Overall, using sealed classes in C# can help you create more secure, maintainable, and efficient code, and can be an important tool in your object-oriented programming toolkit.
