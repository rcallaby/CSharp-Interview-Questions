# CORE - Question 05 - Explain the benefits of using Just In Time compliation in .Net Core?

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation in .NET Core is a key performance optimization mechanism that converts **Intermediate Language (IL)** code into **native machine code** just before execution. Let’s break down the **benefits** of JIT in .NET Core and illustrate each with **code examples, performance comparisons**, and **runtime behaviors**.

---

## 1. **Platform-Specific Optimization**

### Benefit:

The JIT compiler produces machine code tailored to the **CPU and operating system** it’s running on. This allows for instruction set optimizations (e.g., using SSE2, AVX).

### 🧪 Example:

```csharp
public static void MultiplyVectors()
{
    float[] a = new float[1000];
    float[] b = new float[1000];
    float[] result = new float[1000];

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        result[i] = a[i] * b[i];
    }
}
```

When compiled with JIT on a CPU that supports SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), .NET Core can **automatically vectorize** this operation via **System.Numerics.Vectors**, improving performance. The same IL could behave differently (and faster) depending on CPU capabilities.

---

## 2. **Adaptive Optimization at Runtime**

### Benefit:

JIT can optimize “hot paths” — frequently executed code — after the app has started. It can **inline methods**, **eliminate bounds checks**, and **optimize branches** dynamically.

### Example:

```csharp
public static int AddNumbers(int a, int b) => a + b;
```

If `AddNumbers` is called inside a loop:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++)
{
    AddNumbers(i, i);
}
```

After enough iterations, JIT can decide to **inline** this method for performance (remove function call overhead).

You can observe this behavior using tools like **PerfView** or **BenchmarkDotNet** with **disassembly analysis**:

```csharp
[Benchmark]
public void InlinedMethodCall() => AddNumbers(5, 10);
```

---

## 3. **Smaller Initial Deployment Size**

### Benefit:

Unlike Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, which produces a full native image for the entire application, JIT compiles methods only **when they’re needed** (on-demand), leading to a smaller distribution size.

This is especially useful for **microservices** and **cloud deployments** where startup performance isn’t the highest priority.

---

## 4. **Support for Dynamic Code**

### Benefit:

JIT enables **runtime code generation**, useful in scenarios like LINQ, expression trees, and dynamic proxies (e.g., `System.Reflection.Emit`).

### Example: Expression Trees

```csharp
Expression<Func<int, int>> square = x => x * x;
var compiled = square.Compile();
Console.WriteLine(compiled(5)); // Output: 25
```

This works because the runtime can **compile code on the fly**. Without JIT, this would be difficult or impossible.

---

## 5. **Tiered Compilation (Since .NET Core 3.0+)**

### Benefit:

.NET Core uses **Tiered Compilation**, where:

* Tier 0: Quick JIT with minimal optimization (faster startup).
* Tier 1: Optimized recompilation after identifying hot code (better throughput).

This balances **startup time** vs **long-term performance**.

### Example: Effect in ASP.NET Core App

If a controller method is hit repeatedly, JIT recompiles it at Tier 1:

```csharp
[HttpGet("/compute")]
public IActionResult Compute()
{
    return Ok(LongRunningCalculation());
}
```

After a few requests, the JIT optimizes `LongRunningCalculation` automatically. You can observe this with **EventPipe** or `dotnet-trace`.

---

## 6. **Better Debugging Experience**

### Benefit:

Since JIT happens at runtime, debugging tools can **map IL to machine code** more easily, making step-through debugging more accurate.

You can inspect:

* IL with `ildasm`
* JIT-compiled code using `dotnet-trace`, `PerfView`, or `SuperPMI`

---

## Counterpoint: When JIT May Not Be Ideal

While JIT has many advantages, there are times when **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** like Native AOT or ReadyToRun may be preferred:

* Low latency startup (e.g., CLI tools, serverless functions).
* Environments where runtime code generation is restricted (e.g., iOS, WASM).
* Shipping fully compiled binaries with no runtime dependency.

## Performance Visualization with BenchmarkDotNet

```csharp
[MemoryDiagnoser]
public class JITDemo
{
    [Benchmark]
    public int StaticMethodCall() => Add(3, 4);

    [Benchmark]
    public int DynamicMethodCall()
    {
        Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;
        return add(3, 4);
    }

    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
}
```

**Expected outcome:**

* `StaticMethodCall` benefits from JIT inlining.
* `DynamicMethodCall` introduces overhead — less JIT-friendly.
