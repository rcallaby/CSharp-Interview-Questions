# Question 13 - Design Patterns

## What is the State pattern in C# and how does it differ from a state machine?

The State design pattern is a design pattern in the field of software engineering that is used to encapsulate state-specific behavior within individual objects, known as states, in such a way that the behavior of an object changes as its state changes. In C#, the State pattern can be implemented using interfaces, abstract classes, or concrete classes.

In a state machine, states and transitions between states are explicitly defined, and the state machine is responsible for maintaining and updating its current state based on events or actions. In contrast, in the State pattern, the responsibility for maintaining and updating the current state is placed on the individual objects representing the states, rather than the state machine.

So, the main difference between the two is that the State pattern focuses on encapsulating state-specific behavior within individual objects, while a state machine focuses on defining and maintaining states and transitions between states. The State pattern provides a more object-oriented approach to state management, as it allows for the encapsulation of behavior within individual objects, making the code more maintainable and reusable.
