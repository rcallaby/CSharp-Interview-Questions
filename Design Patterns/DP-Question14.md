# Question 14 - Design Patterns

## How can you use the Template Method pattern in C# to define the steps of an algorithm and allow subclasses to provide their own implementation?

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the steps of an algorithm and allows subclasses to provide their own implementation for some of these steps. In C#, this can be achieved by creating an abstract base class that defines the template method and implements the algorithm, and subclasses that inherit from this base class and override specific steps.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```
abstract class DataProcessor
{
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        ReadData();
        TransformData();
        WriteData();
    }

    protected abstract void ReadData();
    protected abstract void TransformData();
    protected abstract void WriteData();
}

class ConcreteDataProcessor1 : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ReadData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Reading data using method 1");
    }

    protected override void TransformData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Transforming data using method 1");
    }

    protected override void WriteData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Writing data using method 1");
    }
}

class ConcreteDataProcessor2 : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ReadData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Reading data using method 2");
    }

    protected override void TransformData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Transforming data using method 2");
    }

    protected override void WriteData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Writing data using method 2");
    }
}

```
In this example, the DataProcessor class defines the template method ProcessData that implements the algorithm, and the ReadData, TransformData, and WriteData methods, which are abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. The ConcreteDataProcessor1 and ConcreteDataProcessor2 classes inherit from the DataProcessor class and provide their own implementation for the ReadData, TransformData, and WriteData methods.

By using the Template Method pattern, you can define the steps of an algorithm once in the base class and allow subclasses to customize the implementation of specific steps without affecting the overall structure of the algorithm.
