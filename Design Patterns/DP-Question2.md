# Question 2 - Design Patterns

# What is the difference between a design pattern and a Architecture Pattern?

A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It provides a way to structure the code in a maintainable and scalable way, without having to write the same code over and over again. Design patterns are typically focused on specific software development tasks, such as creating objects, managing dependencies, or managing the flow of control. Examples of design patterns in C# include the Singleton pattern, Factory Method pattern, and the Observer pattern.

On the other hand, an architecture pattern is a high-level, overall approach to designing the structure of a software system. It defines the way in which different parts of a system interact and collaborate with each other to fulfill the requirements of the system. Architecture patterns provide a blueprint for organizing the code, dividing it into modules, and managing the relationships between these modules. Examples of architecture patterns in C# include the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, and the Microservices pattern.

Design patterns are focused on solving specific design problems, while architecture patterns are focused on providing a high-level, overall structure for the code.
