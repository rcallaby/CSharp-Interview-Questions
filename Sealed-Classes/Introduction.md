# Sealed Classes - Introduction

Sealed classes in C# are classes that cannot be inherited. When a class is declared as sealed, it cannot be used as a base class for any other class. This means that the methods and properties of a sealed class cannot be overridden by any subclass. Sealed classes are useful when you want to prevent further modification of the behavior of the class or when you want to ensure that the class remains stable over time.

To create a sealed class in C#, you simply add the "sealed" keyword to the class definition. Here's an example:

```
sealed class MySealedClass
{
    // class definition here
}

```

## There are a number of reasons why you might want to master the use of sealed classes in C# for a technical interview:

Performance: Sealed classes can be faster than non-sealed classes because the runtime doesn't need to check for potential overrides of virtual or abstract members. By using sealed classes, you can help to ensure that your code runs as efficiently as possible.

Security: Sealed classes can help to improve the security of your code by preventing attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in derived classes. By preventing inheritance, you can help to limit the potential attack surface of your code.

Maintainability: Sealed classes can help to make your code more maintainable by reducing the complexity of class hierarchies. By preventing further inheritance, you can help to simplify the design of your code and make it easier to understand.

Correctness: Sealed classes can help to ensure that your code behaves as expected by preventing derived classes from modifying the behavior of the base class. This can be particularly important in situations where you need to ensure that a class behaves consistently over time.

Mastering the use of sealed classes in C# is an important aspect of writing high-quality, efficient, and secure code. By understanding when and how to use sealed classes, you can help to ensure that your code is maintainable, correct, and performs well. If you're preparing for a technical interview, it's a good idea to make sure that you have a solid understanding of sealed classes and how they can be used effectively in C#.
