# Translations

This repository contains a collection of C# interview questions and answers in English. However, we welcome contributions from speakers of other languages who would like to translate these questions and answers into their native language. If you are interested in contributing a translation, please follow the guidelines below.

## Guidelines
+ Fork this repository and create a new branch for your translation work.
+ Create a new folder in the repository with the name of the language you are translating into (e.g. "es" for Spanish).
+ Create a new file in your language's folder for each interview question and answer, using the following format for the file name: question-number-answer.md. For example, if you are translating the answer to question 5, the file name would be 5-answer.md.
+ Translate the English text in the answer.md file into your language.
+ Submit a pull request with your changes, making sure to include a description of the changes you made and the language you translated into.
