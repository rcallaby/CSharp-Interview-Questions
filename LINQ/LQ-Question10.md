# Question 10 - LINQ

## Can you explain the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and how it relates to LINQ code?

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a design principle in object-oriented programming that aims to reduce the coupling between software modules. The principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This means that the code should be written in such a way that changes in one module do not affect other modules that depend on it.

LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a feature in .NET that provides a consistent way to query data from different data sources. LINQ allows you to write queries against collections of objects, databases, XML documents, and other data sources in a language-independent way.

The Dependency Inversion Principle can be applied to LINQ code by separating the business logic from the data access logic. This can be done by defining an interface that represents the data access logic and implementing it in a separate class. The business logic can then depend on the interface rather than the concrete implementation.

For example, consider the following LINQ query:

```
var customers = from c in db.Customers
                where c.City == "London"
                select c;

```
This query depends on the Customers table in the database. If the schema of the table changes, the query may no longer work. To apply the Dependency Inversion Principle, we can define an interface that represents the data access logic:

```
public interface ICustomerRepository
{
    IQueryable<Customer> GetCustomersByCity(string city);
}

```
We can then implement this interface in a separate class:

```
public class CustomerRepository : ICustomerRepository
{
    private readonly MyDbContext db;

    public CustomerRepository(MyDbContext db)
    {
        this.db = db;
    }

    public IQueryable<Customer> GetCustomersByCity(string city)
    {
        return from c in db.Customers
               where c.City == city
               select c;
    }
}

```
The business logic can now depend on the ICustomerRepository interface rather than the concrete implementation:

```
public class CustomerService
{
    private readonly ICustomerRepository customerRepository;

    public CustomerService(ICustomerRepository customerRepository)
    {
        this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
    }

    public IQueryable<Customer> GetCustomersByCity(string city)
    {
        return customerRepository.GetCustomersByCity(city);
    }
}

```
By applying the Dependency Inversion Principle, we have separated the business logic from the data access logic, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. If the schema of the Customers table changes, we only need to update the implementation of the ICustomerRepository interface, and the business logic remains unchanged.
