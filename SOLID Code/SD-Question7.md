# Question 7 - SOLID

## What is Dependency Injection, and how can it help to reduce tight coupling in C# code?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows the separation of an object's dependencies from its implementation. Instead of creating dependencies inside an object, they are injected from outside, thus reducing the object's tight coupling with its dependencies.

In C#, DI is typically implemented through an Inversion of Control (IoC) container. The container manages the creation and lifetime of the object's dependencies, and injects them into the object's constructor, properties or methods, as required.

Here's an example of how DI can help to reduce tight coupling in C# code:

Consider a class UserService that depends on a UserRepository to perform database operations. Without DI, the code might look like this:

```
public class UserService
{
    private UserRepository _userRepository;
    
    public UserService()
    {
        _userRepository = new UserRepository();
    }

    public User GetUser(int id)
    {
        return _userRepository.GetUser(id);
    }

    public void AddUser(User user)
    {
        _userRepository.AddUser(user);
    }

    // ...other methods...
}

```
The problem with this code is that the UserService class is tightly coupled with the UserRepository. If the implementation of the repository changes, or if we need to switch to a different repository, we'll have to modify the UserService class, which violates the Open-Closed Principle of SOLID design.

With DI, we can remove this tight coupling by injecting the UserRepository into the UserService constructor. Here's how the code would look like:

```
public class UserService
{
    private IUserRepository _userRepository;
    
    public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User GetUser(int id)
    {
        return _userRepository.GetUser(id);
    }

    public void AddUser(User user)
    {
        _userRepository.AddUser(user);
    }

    // ...other methods...
}

```
Now, the UserService class is no longer responsible for creating the UserRepository. Instead, it receives an instance of the repository from outside. This makes the code more flexible, and easier to maintain and test. Additionally, we can switch to a different implementation of the IUserRepository interface without modifying the UserService class.
